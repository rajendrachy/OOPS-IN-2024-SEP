//Language that support oops features include c++, smalltalk, java,etc.
//It is a general-purpose programming language designed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an 
//extension to the C language
// The three most important facilities that C++ adds on to C are classes, inheritance, 
//function overloading, and operator overloading. 
//C++ is C: C++ supports (almost) all the features of C. 

// ____________Program_________________

// #include<iostream> // Needed to use IO (Input Output) functions
// using namespace std;

// int main()
// {
//   cout<<"Hello World!";
//   // This is a comment. Above line will just print Hello World! On screen.

//   /* This is an example of multi-line comment, 
//   instead of one line you can also write multi-line comments which generally used to provide readability of code. 
//   These must start end with proper constructs as shown here. */
  
//   return 0;
// Return 0 to indicate normal termination

// }



// ______________Program Notes______________

// 1. ________using namespace std;__________
// -> ans :-> The names cout and endl belong to the std namespace. 


// 2. ___________return 0;______________
// The return value of 0 indicates normal termination; 
// while non-zero (typically 1) indicates abnormal termination. 
// C++ compiler will automatically insert a "return 0;" at the end of the the main() function, thus, 
//it statement can be omitted.(omitted-> removed)

//___ "#include <cstdlib>"._______
// use EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE



// 3. _______Comments___________
// Multi-line Comment: begins with a /* and ends with a */, and can span several lines.
//End-of-line Comment: begins with // and lasts till the end of the current line.


// 4.______________Statement______________
// A programming statement must be terminated by a semi-colon (;)
// just like an English sentence ends with a period.


// // Each of the following lines is a programming statement, which ends with a semi-colon (;)
// int number1 = 10;
// int number2, number3 = 99;
// int product;
// product = number1 * number2 * number3;
// cout << "Hello" << endl;


//5. ____________Block______________
//A block (or a compound statement) is a group of statements surrounded by braces {}
// All the statements inside the block is treated as one unit.
